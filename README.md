A Repository of basic algorithms

We have created a Github repo full of basic algorithms that a data scientist should know. Knowledge of basic algorithms provide a good foundation to solve newer problems and it often helps not to reinvent the wheel. So, fork us. 

One reminder is that the repository is work in progress. Feel free to contribute to it.

Here is a complete index of the algorithms and data structures completed (as of 30 Dec 2014):

1. Data Structures
  * LinkedList
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Heap (Max and Min)
  * Tree
  * Graph
2. Sorting Algorithms
  * Bubble Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Counting Sort
  * Bucket Sort
3. Search Algorithms
  * Binary Search
  * Breadth First Search (Binary Tree)
  * Depth First Search (Binary Tree)
4. Graph Algorithms

  * Breadth First Traversal
  * Un-weighted Shortest Path
  * Weighted Shortest Path (Djikstra)
  * Weighted Shortest Path (Bellman-Ford)
